# Statistical-Machine-Learning

This respository contains various coding assignments for CS 671, statistical machine learning, at Duke University with Cynthia Rudin. 
These coding assignments involved hand implementations of many popular algorithms such as adaboost, support vector machines, and 
neural networks, as well as machine learning concepts such as nested cross validation, and kernels. Aside from coding assignments,
the homeworks for this class involved mathematical proofs and analyses of various machine learning concepts.
